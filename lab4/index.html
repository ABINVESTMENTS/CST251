<h1>Aaron Borum</h1>
<h2>I am a ceramic artist from Salinas, California. I started taking classes at Hartnell
College and now have a studio in my garage where I run my business</h2>
<h3>I have been feeling overwhelmed with all the school work from this semester
but this is what I signed up for. Looking forward to a great semester</h3>
<h4>Through this lab, I had challenges closing the tags and also uploading images
because I was forgetting to put the .jpg at the end. I am learning a lot from these mistakes.
I believe that I am not putting enough effort towards coding. I need to focus more on these
assignments.</h4>
