  <h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p >The challenges that I had with this lab were trying to make it visually pleasing.
  It can be frustrating when you know where something should be on a web page, but still
  figuring out how to put what I envision in my head into actual code. </p>


	<h1>Problems</h1>

	<p >I wasn;t able to get the sidebar to the right of the page, it was on the left
  hand side. Other than that, I didn't have too many problems besides coding grammar
errors </p>
	<h1>Results</h1>

	<p >I noticed that on my other labs, I was copy and pasting the code so I didn't really
  even know what I was doing. I felt like I was faking it and developing bad habits
of taking way too many shortcuts. This lab was different because I actually decided
to start from scratch and take the time to actually understand the concepts that
I was implimenting on my webpage. I feel a lot more confident style my page but understand
that I have a ways to go before I can comfortable code without always having to copy
and paste</p>
