	 Archaeological evidence, together with the example of primitive tribes in recent times,
	 suggests that the earliest containers used by neolithic man range from hollowed out pieces
	  of stone or wood to more elaborate artefacts such as bags of animal skin and, above all,
		 baskets. Basketry is one of the earliest crafts to be developed. Almost every region of
		 the world has suitable materials, in grasses, reeds or willows, and the resulting object
		  is both cheap and light.


</div>
 <div class="col-sm-6">But baskets are not good for containing liquids.
	  For that purpose early technology soon finds another material which is cheap,
		widely available and (by comparison with stone) relatively light. This material is clay.
		Not all societies have developed the useful craft of pottery. Nomads tend not to be potters.
		The technical demands of pottery do not fit well with life on the move, and pots are too fragile
		for a nomadic existence. Equally, in areas where nature provides admirable pots in the form of gourds,
		the potter's trade seems an unnecessary labour.



</div>
 <div class="col-sm-3">When a pot is built up from the base by hand, it is impossible that it should be perfectly round.
	 The solution to this problem ia the potter's wheel, which has been a crucial factor in the history of ceramics.
	 It is not known when or where the potter's wheel is introduced. Indeed it is likely that it develops very gradually,
	 from a platform on which the potter turns the pot before shaping another side (thus avoiding having to walk around it).

By about 3000 BC a simple revolving wheel is a part of the potter's equipment in Mesopotamia, the cradle of so many innovations.

	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>I had challenges with my photos overlapping on this lab. My partner was having the same problem but we ended up figuring it out by putting
	the max width to 100% for the images in our css</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>I think technology can be a problem in itself. Things get complicated but I still worked through
	any problems I was having because I know how important it is for me to understand this!</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>I am amazing with bootstrap. I am sure that I haven't even made a dent on the surface with all the cool things that I can do!</p>
