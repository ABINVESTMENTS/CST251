	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>I had challenges with my photos overlapping on this lab. My partner was having the same problem but we ended up figuring it out by putting
	the max width to 100% for the images in our css</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>I think technology can be a problem in itself. Things get complicated but I still worked through
	any problems I was having because I know how important it is for me to understand this!</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>I am amazing with bootstrap. I am sure that I haven't even made a dent on the surface with all the cool things that I can do!</p>
