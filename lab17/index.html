  <h1>Challenges</h1>

    <p>I enjoyed working on this lab, it took some time to get everything organized
    but over time it started looking good.</p>

  <h1>Problems</h1>

    <p>The problems I had were trying to figure out a layout work visually. Overall
    everything seemed pretty straight forward.</p>

  <h1>Results</h1>

    <p>Through this lab, I was able to break down the design process in a way
    that will allow me to see what is neccesary to design an aesthetically pleasing
  webpage.</p>
