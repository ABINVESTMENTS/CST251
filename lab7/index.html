	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>I intially had challenges of linking the css file to my html but eventually
	figured out what I was doing wrong due to help from my partner.</p><br>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>I noticed that I was getting frustrated the deeper I got into the code. My
	mistakes were something small like not having a closed alligator or something.</p><br>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>I truly enjoyed this lab and encorporating CSS into the html file. I enjoy
	the visual design aspect of websites more than words so being able to do this
was a lot of fun. I feel like there are so many directions that you can take <thead>
	CSS to customize your site. I am excited to keep learning new tricks
