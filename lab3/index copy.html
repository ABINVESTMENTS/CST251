<h1>For me, the importance of this lab was to gain a better understanding of
  structure. It's important to know where your files are at all times so that way
  you won't be lost looking for them. Folders should be well organized and lower
  case.</h1>
<h2>The difficulties I encountered were trying to get the image to show up on the
actual website. At first I saved the .jpg as upper case but put the code in
lower case. The next problem that I had was putting img/ instead of images/ for my
folder name. After I figured out what was wrong, I went back to correct it.</h2>
<h3>I learned a lot from this lab. Although I am still an extreme beginner
when it comes to coding, I feel like I am headed in the right direction from working
through these exercises. On this assignment, I did not work with my partner due
to the fact that I started to work on this last minute.</h3>
