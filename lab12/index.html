  <h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p >I was having challenges getting my css changes to show up on the browser. I noticed
  that grammatical errors were preventing my page from linking. </p>

  <h1>Problems</h1>
	<p >The problems I had resided with figuring out how to center everything and understand
  how to customize it in a way that is unique.</p>

	<h1>Results</h1>

	<p >This has been my favorite lab so far due to the subject matter that was applied
  to it. Lakers just won the championship so my page was inspired by that. I am getting
a lot more comfortable with coding. I can only imagine how far along I'll be by the end
of the semester</p>
