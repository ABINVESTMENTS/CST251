<h1>Hello World
My name is Aaron Borum, and I currently run a ceramic business called ABCERAMICSS. I started working with clay in 2016 and haven't stopped since. I plan on expanding my business by acquiring land where I can build a studio (Currently working out of garage) Aside from this, I enjoy meditation, investing, and taking care of my health by any means. I'm 24 years old and live in Salinas California. Feel free to follow my instagram @ABCERAMICSS</h1>
